## Available Guides

- [How to Write Effective Tasks](how-to-write-effective-tasks.md) - Guidelines for creating clear, comprehensive task descriptions for AI coding agents
- [Task Example](task-example.md) - A template example of a well-structured implementation task

## Purpose

These guides provide standardized processes and templates to ensure consistent development practices across the project. Following these guidelines helps maintain code quality, architectural alignment, and efficient development workflows.

By using these guides:

1. Development tasks will be clearly defined with explicit requirements
2. Implementation will follow consistent patterns
3. Testing will be comprehensive and follow TDD principles
4. Documentation will be complete and standardized

Use these guides as references when creating new tasks or implementing features for the NCAA Basketball Analytics Project.
