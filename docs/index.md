# NCAA Basketball Analytics Project

[TOC]

Welcome to the documentation for the NCAA Basketball Analytics Project. This project provides data processing pipelines, analytics, and prediction models for NCAA basketball games.

## Project Overview

The NCAA Basketball Analytics Project leverages a modern data architecture to collect, process, and analyze basketball data from various sources. The project follows a medallion architecture with DuckDB integration for efficient data processing and storage.

## Key Components

- **Data Pipeline**: Extract data from ESPN APIs and transform into analytical datasets
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate advanced metrics and statistics for teams and players
- **Prediction Models**: Machine learning models for game outcome prediction
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards for exploring the data
